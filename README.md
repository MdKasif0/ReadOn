## ðŸŒŠ Data Flow Architecture

The application employs a sophisticated "stale-while-revalidate" data flow to ensure a fast and reliable user experience.

1.  **Scheduled Fetching**: A Netlify scheduled function runs every 2 hours, triggering an API route in the Next.js app.
2.  **Firestore Caching**: This route fetches the latest news from the Newsdata.io API for all predefined categories. The articles are then processed, normalized, and stored in a shared **Firestore** database. This acts as our central, server-side cache.
3.  **Client-Side Caching**: When a user opens the app, it first attempts to load articles from the local **IndexedDB** cache.
4.  **Offline-First Logic**:
    - If fresh data (fetched < 2 hours ago) exists in IndexedDB, it is displayed instantly.
    - If the local data is stale or missing, the app fetches the latest articles from the Firestore cache.
    - This newly fetched data is then used to update the UI and is saved back to IndexedDB to keep the local cache fresh.
5.  **PWA & Service Worker**: A Service Worker caches the application shell (the core HTML, CSS, and JS), allowing the app to load instantly and function offline. It also includes logic to automatically handle updates, ensuring users always have the latest version.
6.  **Cache Cleanup**: To manage device storage, articles stored in IndexedDB are automatically deleted after 30 days.
